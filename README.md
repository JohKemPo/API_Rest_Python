<p align="justify">&emsp; In this section, we'll provide an overview of what RESTful APIs are and their importance in modern web development. You'll learn about the principles and concepts behind RESTful APIs and how they enable communication between different applications. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial before diving into the practical implementation with Flask.</p><br>

<h2 id="setup"><b>SETTING UP FLASK</b></h2><br>

<p align="justify">&emsp; Before we start building our RESTful API, we need to set up Flask, the Python web framework that will facilitate our development process. In this section, you'll find step-by-step instructions on how to install Flask, create a basic application, and run it locally. Additionally, we'll explore the essential tools and libraries that work well with Flask to streamline development.</p><br>

<h2 id="endpoints"><b>CREATING ENDPOINTS</b></h2><br>

<p align="justify">&emsp; Endpoints are the heart of any RESTful API, serving as the communication interface between clients and the server. In this section, you'll learn how to define endpoints with Flask and handle different HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. We'll cover routing, request handling, and response formatting to create a well-structured API.</p><br>

<h2 id="data"><b>HANDLING DATA</b></h2><br>

<p align="justify">&emsp; RESTful APIs often involve data manipulation and storage. In this section, we'll explore various methods to handle data with Flask, including interacting with databases, working with JSON, and handling data validation. You'll learn how to build a robust data pipeline for your API to ensure smooth data flow between the server and clients.</p><br>

<h2 id="auth"><b>AUTHENTICATION AND SECURITY</b></h2><br>

<p align="justify">&emsp; Securing your API is vital to protect sensitive information and maintain user privacy. In this section, we'll delve into different authentication methods, such as token-based authentication and OAuth. You'll also learn about common security practices to safeguard your API from potential threats and attacks.</p><br>

<h2 id="best-practices"><b>BEST PRACTICES</b></h2><br>

<p align="justify">&emsp; Building a high-quality API requires adherence to best practices and industry standards. In this section, we'll cover essential best practices for designing, documenting, and testing your RESTful API. By following these guidelines, you'll create an API that is robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.</p><br>
